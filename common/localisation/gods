cinematographer_DESC;The Cinematographers are people that believe the world was created by the great god Oscar, which rewarded people who create realities and histories like him with the honour of his Holy presence for a time. The society is normally separated on four classes, The actors, whom must act as inspirational figures and show the masses culture, The directors, whomst must organize the acting of the actors, and the Producers, that try to gather resources and build artifacts to people act. And the public, which are the rest that watches the movies. After the end, the actors were basically drafted to be protectors of the public. During the movies, that are made with the actors in front of the public on the Studios, there it is a Camera, that's recording the movie for the dead watch too. Every year, the most talented person will be given the Oscar for a year, Retrospectively, the most un-talented person will be given the Raspberry award for a year. Ever since times immemorial, the movies that are most respected are Dramas, and the un-respected are comedies. Not that it's sinful per se, but it's simply harder for comedies to be registered.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
